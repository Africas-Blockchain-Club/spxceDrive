# SpxceDrive

## Overview
**SpxceDrive** facilitates decentralized file sharing and syncing using IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and Scroll Vortex. It allows users to securely upload, share, and sync files without relying on a centralized server. The application utilizes Next.js for frontend development, Solidity smart contracts deployed on Scroll Vortex for file management, QuickNode for IPFS integration, and Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI for UI design. Social login functionality is enabled through dynamic.xyz.


## Features

- **Decentralized File Sharing :** Upload and share files securely using IPFS and Scroll Vortex.
- **Syncing :** Real-time synchronization of files across multiple devices.
- **Smart Contracts :** Ensure the integrity and authenticity of shared files through Solidity smart contracts deployed on Scroll Vortex.
- **UI Design :** Clean and responsive UI design crafted with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI.
- **Social Login :** Seamlessly log in using social authentication provided by dynamic.xyz.
